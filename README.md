This project is a "practice" project involving basic react functions such as useStates,ref,useImperative, etc. while using a css framework called tailwind for a more cleaner and dynamic look

This Repository DOES NOT HAVE ANY USER AUTHENTICATION FUNCTIONALITIES. Instead its more of a "front-end" look.
